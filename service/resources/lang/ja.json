    "!#$@ ALERT TO YOU. AND PLZ LISTEN MY RAGE !#$@":
        "OK, Laravel DO NOT follow their own rules for the localization. So you have to re-create these non-handled translations for EVERY f*cken lazy implementations. Jetstream is especially horrible. In some cases, they did not even try to use __ function to bypass the localization process. You can not use `vendor overrides` because of this. ARRGHHHHH!!!! ...Sorry for this stupid rage. But you have to check and fix every module's `raw messages` within the `vendor` dir... sounds cool, right? Some contributers are really lazy and they force you to do additional boring hacks: like `wrap whole target classes and recdirect messages to __() one by one`. Also, in this way, if they change even only-single-character, all relations between language-confs will be gone. Awesome. PLZ NAME IT IF ITS UNIQUE IN YOUR CODES!!! IMO, This JSON should not be used as a `master` translation data. Too unhealthy location to do so. This file should be generated and cached automatically. But it seems they dont think so. Just. Shame. Thank you.",
